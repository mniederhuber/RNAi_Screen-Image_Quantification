Workflow


- generate `sample_sheet.tsv` in the `sheets/` dir, using `sheet_gen.py` to build sheet with ids and filepaths to all .lif files in the working directory
- run `image_parser.py` 
	- `image_parser.py` takes `sample_sheet.tsv` and `results_fp.csv', the latter is currently generated by an outside Rnotebook
